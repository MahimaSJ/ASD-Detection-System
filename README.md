Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often misunderstood
 and difficult to identify, especially in its early stages. Many
 parents notice unusual behaviors in their child—like avoiding
 eye contact, delayed speech, or repetitive actions—but aren’t
 sure what they mean or how serious they are. Getting a
 professional diagnosis can be challenging, especially in areas
 where access to specialists is limited or where families are
 hesitant due to social stigma or financial constraints. Even
 when help is available, the process can be long, stressful, and
 emotionally draining, leaving families without the clarity or
 support they need during a critical time.
 In today’s digital world, there’s an opportunity to make this
 process easier, faster, and more accessible. By using video
based technology, we can observe a child’s behavior naturally,
 without the pressure of clinical settings. But detection alone
 isn’t enough—families also need guidance, reassurance, and
 emotional support. That’s why this project aims to not only
 detect possible signs of ASD through AI-powered video anal
ysis but also offer real-time assistance through a chatbot. This
 digital companion helps bridge the gap between uncertainty
 and action, giving families the comfort of immediate support
 and helping them take informed next steps.
